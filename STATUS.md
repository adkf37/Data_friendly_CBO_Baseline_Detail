## Current Objective

Complete **Validate** for **Task ID: `task-03-transform`** (remaining-programs slice) by confirming the full unittest suite, repo-root CLI smoke check, real `--slice remaining-programs` transform run, and output-integrity audit all satisfy the transform acceptance criteria with no silently dropped included sheets.

## Recent Activity

- 2026-05-11: Validate passed for **Task ID: `task-03-transform`** (remaining-programs slice) — reran dependency install, full unittest suite, repo-root CLI smoke check, a real `python src/transform.py --slice remaining-programs --output-dir /tmp/cbo_transform_validate_remaining` run, and an output-integrity audit. Validation caught and fixed an over-broad `"nutrition"` health keyword so `child_nutrition*` datasets route into the remaining-programs slice. After the fix, all 120 included remaining-programs parse-plan entries were accounted for via CSV output or explicit parse-error logging, 73 datasets were written with the required headers, duplicate keys remained at 0, and `implausible_year_rows=0`. Routed to Closeout.
- 2026-05-11: Build advanced for **Task ID: `task-03-transform`** (remaining-programs slice) — added `remaining-programs` to `SLICE_CHOICES` and extended `_in_slice` in `src/transform.py` so the new slice selects all included parse-plan datasets that are not matched by health or income-security keywords. Added regression test `test_run_transform_remaining_programs_slice_excludes_health_and_income_security`. Full unittest suite passes 12 tests. Routed to Validate.
- 2026-05-11: Closeout completed for **Task ID: `task-03-transform`** (income security slice) — independently rechecked the task acceptance criteria, latest validation report, full unittest suite, repo-root CLI help, a real `python src/transform.py --slice income-security --output-dir /tmp/cbo_closeout_income` run, and an output-integrity audit. Confirmed all 118 included income-security parse-plan entries were accounted for via CSV output or explicit parse-error logging, 72 datasets were written with the required headers, duplicate keys remained at 0, and `implausible_year_rows=0`. Returned the repo to **Build** for the remaining-programs slice of `task-03-transform`.
- 2026-05-11: Validate passed for **Task ID: `task-03-transform`** (income security slice) — dependency install, full unittest suite, CLI smoke check, real income-security transform run, and output-integrity audit completed. All 118 included income-security parse-plan entries were accounted for via CSV output or explicit parse-error logging, 72 datasets were written with the required headers, duplicate keys remained at 0, and `implausible_year_rows=0`. Routed to Closeout with 37 explicit parse errors preserved as follow-up risk in `parse_errors.log`.
- 2026-05-11: Build advanced for **Task ID: `task-03-transform`** (income security slice) — routed the sprint's next unfinished item to the Data Engineer/Tester path in `.squad/routing.md`, added explicit `--slice income-security` handling in `src/transform.py`, and added regression test `test_run_transform_income_security_slice_excludes_health_datasets`. `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` now passes 10 tests, and a real `python src/transform.py --slice income-security --output-dir /tmp/cbo_transform_income` smoke run wrote 72 income-security datasets with 37 explicit parse errors surfaced in `parse_errors.log`. Routed to Validate.
- 2026-05-11: Tasks 01, 02, and 02b marked complete. Generated `config/workbook_parse_plan.yaml` (230 workbooks, 335 sheets, 299 included). Advanced to Build for `task-03-transform`.

## Remaining Follow-up

- **Next task:** Close out **`task-03-transform`** now that all three ordered transform slices have validation evidence.
- Known parser-improvement follow-up: 14 health-slice parse errors, 37 income-security parse errors, and 39 remaining-programs parse errors remain surfaced explicitly in `parse_errors.log`; these should guide later parser-improvement work but do not block slice closeout.
- Schema generation, verification, and pipeline handoff remain downstream after transform closeout, with `task-04-schema` as the next ordered sprint item.
